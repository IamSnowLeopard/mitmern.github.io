## Project Name: 
Fly Catcher (for desktop and tablet only) completed by Rahmat Muhammad

## Description: 
This is a fun, interactive web application that generates flies as objects on click events and launches them in random directions within a container. A pair of eyes follow your cursor movement as you "chase" each fly. Clicking on a fly makes it disappear from the screen.

## Features:
* Add flies to a container
* Launch the flies, and watch them move randomly in the container
* Flies bounce back upon hitting the edges
* Eyes follow cursor movement
* Click on a fly to "catch" it and make it disappear from the screen

1. Clone the repository or download the source code
2. Open FlyCatcher.html in a web browser to run the application
3. Use the "Add Flies!" button to add new images to the container
4. Click "Catch Flies!" to start the movement
